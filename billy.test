### TCS
#Create a class called Shape that has
#Attributes for the height, width, and number of sides the shape has -- these will be taken in as arguments in the constructor
#Additionally, an area / volume attribute, calculated in the constructor
#Functions to both change and see an instance of a shape's attributes


###COMMON CLASS PRACTICE: "Getters and setters"
  #Functions that can change or allow user to view certain attributes of an instance of a class
#GET:
  #Returns the attribute in question. EX:
  #def get_Height(self):
    #return self.height
#SET:
  #Changes the attribute question. EX:
  #def set_Height(self,x):
    #self.height = x

#Functions to do the following
#Allow user to change the height, length, or width
#Allow user to change the number of verticies (2D or 3D)
#Allow user to change the number of sides (1, 3, or 4)
#You may assume the following:
  #If shape is 2D: width is always zero
  #Shape can only have 1, 3, or 4 edges
  #All circles are perfect circles
  #All triangles are right triangles

#Should print back the shape's type of shape it is (2D/3D circle/triangle/rectangle, its new dimensions (height/length if 2D, height/length/widht if 3D), and its (updated) area (remember area changes depending on shape type)
