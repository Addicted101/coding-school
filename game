###COMMON CLASS PRACTICE: "Getters and setters"
  #Functions that can change or allow user to view certain attributes of an instance of a class
#GET:
  #Returns the attribute in question. EX:
  #def get_Height(self):
    #return self.height
#SET:
  #Changes the attribute question. EX:
  #def set_Height(self,x):
    #self.height = x

'''
RANDOMNESS EXAMPLE
x = random.uniform(0,10)

if (x > 5):
  Do something

else (x <= 5):
  Do something else

###Text Based Combat###

#Creating different character classes for an RPG. An example would be warrior.
#Create a template (or parent) Character class. This will have attributes of HP (health points), MP (magic points), ATK (attack), DEF (defense), and SPD (speed)
#Create at least four child classes that are different specialties. A classic example is Warrior, Mage, Cleric, and Rogue.
  #These should have all have differing stats as well as an additional ability

#Program flow:
#User will be greeted and prompted to choose from one of these classes. There should be a brief overview of each class before user needs to select one.
#Then, the program will randomly generate an enemy of one of the classes and inform the user what opponent they will be facing. Combat will begin

#Combat will be turn-based; whoever has the highest speed moves first. User (and enemy) will have the opporunity to attack, defend, or use a skill -- skills should use MP.
  #The enemy's decision on what to do will be given as the code is developed
#Whenever the enemy or the player has less than or 0 HP, the game should immediately end, telling the user the result, and asking if they'd like to play again.
